# elm-ascii-art
CMSC223 Functional Programming Project: Turn an uploaded image into ASCII art 

This is a webapp created by Anna Zipp and Krish Suchak to convert images to ASCII art (only works on PNG images due to use of elm-image library). Simply click the file upload button, choose a PNG image, and wait for the ASCII art to load.
